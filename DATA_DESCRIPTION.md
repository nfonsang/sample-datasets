# Dataset Description

### üìÅ Dataset: Customer Satisfaction Data
This synthetic dataset simulates customer interactions and outcomes across various retail stores. It includes transaction details, product categories, employee experience, and customer satisfaction scores.

The dataset is ideal for demonstrating supervised learning techniques, particularly for a regression task with the target variable: `Satisfaction`.

There are 1,000 records, and the dataset includes the following columns:

| Column Name    | Description                                                                |

### üìÅ Dataset: Customer Churn Data 
This churn dataset captures customer profiles and banking activity, commonly used for modeling customer churn, predicting whether a customer will leave or stay with the bank.

It supports supervised classification tasks, with the target variable: Exited, where:

1 = the customer churned (left the bank)

0 = the customer stayed

 Available Versions
Large Churn Dataset ([churn_data_large.csv](./churn_data_large.csv)): 165,034 records: 

Small Churn Dataset ([churn_data_small.csv](./churn_data_small.csv)): 10,000 records, randomly sampled from the large churn dataset

Each record represents an individual customer, with associated demographic and behavioral features.
